# Code Club

A club for solving fun coding problems.
May involve learning to code.

## Project Euler
This is a collection of solutions to Project Euler problems for Code Club.
Starting at the very first problem, a problem will be completed each week.
At the end of the week, we get together on Discord and discuss our solutions.

## Snake
This is a multiplayer PvP snake game where the players are controlled by AIs written by Code Club members.
The AI agents compete in a long-running competition, and members must improve their agents in order to stay on top of the leaderboards.
